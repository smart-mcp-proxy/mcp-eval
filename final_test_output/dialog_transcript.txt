Multi-Agent Dialog: Simple Server Status Check

============================================================

User (Turn 0):
Can you quickly check if my servers are running okay?

Agent (Turn 1):
I'll help check your MCP servers' status. Let me use the upstream_servers tool to list and check their status.
I see 2 servers configured:

1. "defillama-mcp" - This server is enabled but currently quarantined. This is likely because it's a newly added server (created 2025-08-31).

2. "everything-2" - This server is enabled and active (not quarantined). It's running as a Docker container.

Let me check the quarantine status to get more details:
Yes, this confirms that defillama-mcp is in quarantine. This is normal for newly added servers as a security measure. If you need to use the defillama-mcp server, you'll need to unquarantine it through the system tray UI or manual config editing.

Would you like me to:
1. Check the logs of any specific server?
2. Help you unquarantine the defillama-mcp server?
3. Something else?
Tool calls:
  - mcp__mcpproxy__upstream_servers
  - mcp__mcpproxy__quarantine_security

User (Turn 1):
Thanks, that looks good! I'm happy to see everything-2 is running fine. I can unquarantine defillama-mcp later if I need it.

Agent (Turn 2):
Great! Yes, everything-2 is running properly and not quarantined, so you should have access to all its tools. Let me know if you need any help with managing the servers or using their tools in the future!

User (Turn 2):
Perfect, thanks for checking!
