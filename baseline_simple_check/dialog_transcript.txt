Multi-Agent Dialog: Simple Server Status Check

============================================================

User (Turn 0):
Can you quickly check if my servers are running okay?

Agent (Turn 1):
I'll help you check the status of your MCP servers. Let me use the upstream_servers tool to list all servers and their status.
I can see two servers in your configuration:

1. `defillama-mcp`:
   - Protocol: stdio
   - Status: Enabled but currently quarantined
   - Last updated: Recently (2025-08-31)

2. `everything-2`:
   - Protocol: stdio (running via Docker)
   - Status: Enabled and not quarantined
   - Last updated: Recently (2025-08-31)

Let me also check the server logs to ensure they're running properly.
Here's the status of your servers:

1. `everything-2` is running perfectly:
   - Successfully connected and initialized
   - Running in Docker container
   - No errors in recent logs
   - Last successful connection at 2025-08-31T16:35:32

2. `defillama-mcp` is having issues:
   - Currently quarantined
   - Error: Cannot find Python executable in PATH
   - Multiple failed connection attempts
   - You may need to fix the Python path or installation for this server

Would you like me to help you troubleshoot the defillama-mcp server issues or would you like more information about any specific server?
Tool calls:
  - mcp__mcpproxy__upstream_servers
  - mcp__mcpproxy__upstream_servers
  - mcp__mcpproxy__upstream_servers

User (Turn 1):
Thanks, that looks good. The everything-2 server is working fine but I see there's an issue with defillama-mcp's Python path. I'll take a look at fixing that separately.

Agent (Turn 2):
Understood! Yes, everything-2 is running smoothly and you can investigate the Python path issue for defillama-mcp when you're ready. The everything-2 server should give you access to a wide range of tools in the meantime since it's the "everything" server package.

Is there anything else you'd like me to check about your MCP servers?

User (Turn 2):
Perfect, thanks for checking. That's all I needed to know for now.
